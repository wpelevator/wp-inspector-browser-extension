## Notes

- Uses the latest [`activeTab`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) and [`scripting`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/scripting) extension permissions to limit access to site source code only when the extension is active.

## To Do

- [ ] Use `prefers-color-scheme` media query to adjust the popup styling.
